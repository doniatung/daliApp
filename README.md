# Donia's Application for DALI

To run either of my solutions for the challenges, first clone this repo
```
$ git clone <repo cloning link>
```

### Instructions on Running the 1st Challenge Site

Then change into the correct directory for the 1st challenge
```
$ cd personalSite
```

I tried to get the site deployed, but for some reason had difficulty getting it working with the branching. To run this project, just use your preferred browser (Chrome) to open the file "index.html" and view my personal website! 

### Instructions on Running the 2nd Challenge App

Change into the correct directory:
```
$ cd map
```

Then run the following: 
```
$ yarn start
```
 
A window should eventually open up in your chrome window. If it does not, you should still be able to reach the app by typing "localhost:3000" into your open browser. 

(a note about the second challenge, I'm really having difficulty getting the images to show up. When I inspect the pages, the src of the images seems right, but I do not know why the images themselves aren't showing up. Honestly, if you could explain why, I'd really appreciate it. )

Hope you enjoy!
